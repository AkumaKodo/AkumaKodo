# Providers

Utility's that allow easy database connection.

Supported providers _for now_:

- [x] [Mongodb](https://deno.land/x/mongo)
- [ ] [Postgres](https://deno.land/x/postgres)
- [ ] [mysql](https://deno.land/x/mysql)

_I don't have time to write support for every database, make a pull required if you have your own implementation that we can use._
