## 0.1.0 - 2022-03-19
Initial release of AkumaKodo

### Added
- Interaction Command handling
- Lots of util functions

### Changed
- Added internal slash command handling using events. You can now enable or disable this.
- Logger Errors to warn on un-stable modes.

### Removed
- For now until slash commands are fully implemented, I will not focus on message based commands. You will have to implement them yourself for now.
